Week 14: Reporting

Setting up the push from terminal to GitHub
2.	How did you solve them?
A lot of googling and figuring things out on my own. I actually really enjoyed this process in the end, as it was very rewarding to finally have it work and see the repository end up on github.

Expanding on the functionality of my Linux system monitor.
Task 3: Make a new repository on Git and upload to Github.
